# practice-resume-HTML
This is the resume page i created in pure HTML as a practice web-page for one of my cohort assignments. The page is not hosted currently, I have attached demo screenshots for the web-page in this README. 

Setup steps : 
1. Created a folder named "practice-resume-HTML" and initialized a git repository.
2. Added the HTML file and commited with message "Initial commit" 
3. Linked the local repository to a remote repo ( this repository on github )
4. Wrote HTML on VS Code
